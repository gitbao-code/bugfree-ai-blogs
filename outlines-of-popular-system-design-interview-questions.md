After being a system design interviewer for so long, Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how crucial it is for candidates to have a solid framework in mind during a system design interview. The worst scenario is when a candidate answers questions in a scattered and unstructured way, showing they lack a clear plan.

On the other hand, the best candidates preemptively address the questions the interviewer is likely to ask, delivering a clear and structured answer without needing much guidance.

Here, Iâ€™ve compiled some popular system design interview questions and their answers in [bugfree.ai/system-design](http://bugfree.ai/system-design)
