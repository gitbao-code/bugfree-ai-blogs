# Recommender Systems: How to Evaluate Them Like an Interview-Ready Engineer

If you can't explain how to evaluate a recommender system, you don't fully understand it. Evaluating recommenders means choosing metrics that reflect user value, using protocols that avoid data leakage, and validating impact with real users. Below is a compact, interview-ready guide covering the right metrics, offline vs. online evaluation, common pitfalls, and a checklist you can cite in an interview.

## Core metrics — what to use and why

- Precision@K: Of the top-K items recommended, how many are relevant? Good for measuring immediate recommendation quality.
- Recall@K: Of all relevant items for a user, how many did you retrieve in the top-K? Useful when finding most of the relevant pool matters.
- F1@K: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall — use when you need a balance.
- MAP (Mean Average Precision): Aggregates precision at the ranks where relevant items occur — rewards correctly ranking several relevant items.
- NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Handles graded relevance and discounts lower-ranked hits — position matters.
- CTR (Click-Through Rate) and engagement metrics (time spent, conversions, repeat usage): Reflect real user value in production and capture downstream effects beyond relevance.

Tip: Always report metrics at relevant cutoffs (e.g., @5, @10). For recommendation lists, ranking-aware metrics (MAP, NDCG) are usually more informative than plain accuracy.

## Offline evaluation: how to check generalization

- Train/test split: Use a holdout set to estimate generalization. Prefer time-aware (temporal) splits for sequential data to avoid peeking into the future.
- Cross-validation: Useful for small datasets, but be cautious with temporal dependencies.
- Negative sampling: When explicit negatives are absent, sample negatives carefully — ensure consistent sampling across models.
- Per-user evaluation: Compute metrics per user and aggregate (e.g., mean NDCG) to avoid popular-user bias.
- Prevent leakage: Ensure no interaction from the test period appears in training (exposure bias is common).

Offline evaluation is fast and necessary for iteration, but it’s a proxy — not the final word.

## Online evaluation: validating real impact

- A/B testing: Randomize users to control and treatment, measure CTR, engagement, retention, and business KPIs.
- Statistical significance: Use proper hypothesis testing and track duration, sample size, and variance.
- Ramping and guardrails: Start small, monitor for adverse effects (e.g., increased clicks but decreased retention).
- Instrumentation: Log impressions, clicks, conversions, and contextual data (device, time, experiment id) to analyze results and segment performance.

Online experiments validate whether offline improvements translate to real user value.

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- Using accuracy or RMSE on implicit feedback without proper framing — they often mislead for ranking tasks.
- Random holdouts that ignore temporal order — causes data leakage and optimistic estimates.
- Ignoring position and exposure bias — items users never saw can't be treated as negatives without correction.
- Evaluating only on aggregate metrics — models might perform differently for segments (new users, heavy users).

## Interview-ready evaluation checklist

When asked how you would evaluate a recommender in an interview, you can structure your answer like this:

1. Define success: pick metrics that match business goals (e.g., CTR, bookings, retention).
2. Use ranking-aware offline metrics (NDCG, MAP) at relevant cutoffs and report per-user aggregates.
3. Split data temporally and avoid leakage; handle negatives and exposure bias carefully.
4. Run A/B tests to measure actual user impact and business KPIs; ensure statistical significance and monitoring.
5. Watch for segment-specific performance and offline-online mismatches.

Example short answer: "I’d evaluate models offline with NDCG@10 and MAP, using a temporal holdout to avoid leakage and per-user averages. Then I’d validate improvements in production with an A/B test tracking CTR, engagement, and retention, ensuring significance and monitoring segment behavior."

## Quick takeaways

- Choose metrics that reflect user/business value — position matters in ranking tasks.
- Offline evaluation is for iteration; online experiments are for validation.
- Avoid data leakage and account for exposure/censoring bias.
- Be ready to argue why your chosen metric and evaluation protocol align to the product goal.

Mastering these concepts will let you evaluate recommenders confidently and explain your approach concisely in interviews.
