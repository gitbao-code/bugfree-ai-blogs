One of the common challenges I hear from friends preparing for system design interviews is this: during practice sessions, they feel confident tackling problems, can draft reasonable solutions, and write fairly complete answers.

However, during actual interviews, they often struggle to perform at their best. Nerves take over, and they worry about sounding unclear or unorganized. This anxiety can lead to leaving out critical information or missing key scoring opportunities.

To address this, hereâ€™s a feature on b[ugfree.ai](http://bugfree.ai/): an AI-powered mock interview tool specifically designed for practicing system design interviews.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

*   Select a question you wanna mock from our curated common questions pool.
*   When you activate the AI mock interview feature, you simulate a real interview experience. While writing your answers or sketching diagrams, the AI acts as your interviewer in real time, engaging you in conversation.
*   Just like in an actual system design interview, the AI will ask follow-up questions based on your responses or provide hints if you seem stuck.

The entire interaction is displayed on the left side of the screen, so you can revisit the conversation at any time. Once youâ€™ve completed your system design task, the platform gives you detailed feedback. It scores your performance in three areas:

1.  **Language clarity and communication**
2.  **Quality of written answers**
3.  **Diagrams and visual explanations**

This makes it easy to identify specific areas for improvement and refine your skills.

Another unexpected benefit? Itâ€™s a great way to practice explaining your designs in English. During these sessions, Iâ€™ve realized that my explanations are sometimes unclearâ€Šâ€”â€Ševen AI occasionally has trouble understanding certain phrases or concepts I use! ðŸ˜… If AI struggles, imagine how much harder it would be for a real interviewer to follow.

Practicing with this tool has not only helped me gain confidence in system design interviews but also improved my communication skills. Whether youâ€™re preparing for your next tech interview or just want to sharpen your English-speaking abilities, I highly recommend giving it a try!
