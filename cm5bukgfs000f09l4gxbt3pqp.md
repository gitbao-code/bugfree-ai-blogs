Recently, a colleague of mine has been transitioning to a data-centric role and has immersed himself in the world of SQL. Day in and day out, he would approach me with numerous SQL-related questions, seeking assistance with debugging.

To be honest, SQL can be intricate. Without dedicating adequate time to study it, it‚Äôs challenging to quickly identify and rectify issues. This becomes even more true when faced with some of the more specialized SQL syntax nuances. Those familiar with it can undoubtedly relate.

However, I‚Äôve stumbled upon a game-changing tool! This tool allows you to input the problematic query, and with a single click, it debugs, identifies the issue, and suggests fixes. It even provides explanations¬†, allowing users to compare their code with the corrected version. Reflecting on this, I realize how much time could have been saved had I discovered this earlier.
