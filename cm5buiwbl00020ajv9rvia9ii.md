After spending several weeks collecting and categorizing recent common system design interview questions, I have prepared an outline of corresponding answers. I‚Äôll also note the companies that often pose these questions.

System design interviews are a critical juncture between junior and senior levels, particularly for L4/L5/L6 positions. The importance of this round increases as one progresses in their career.

### Interview Preparation Insights

üîç About the Questions: Each company‚Äôs frequent question types often relate to their industry. For example, Meta often includes system design questions related to social media in their interviews. Google tends to focus on search, big data, and advertising. Uber and Lyft frequently ask about ride-sharing and mapping. Prepare for some classic questions too, as many veteran interviewers use questions from their era, which have now become standard.

üéØ About the Answers: Most system design questions follow a set pattern, so it‚Äôs crucial to train yourself in these methodologies and thought processes. Interviewers are keen to explore ideas aligned with these patterns and expand with follow-up questions. If you only focus on your narrative, it might confuse or even overwhelm the interviewer.

üåü Specialize in Something: Even if you can‚Äôt answer every aspect of a system design question comprehensively, it‚Äôs beneficial to have a strong suit in a specific area, like databases, distributed systems, or operations. If you have experience in these areas, emphasize them in your responses. This approach not only adds points to your profile but also helps to cover weaker areas, playing to your strengths and masking your weaknesses.
