Design Music Player is a frequent question in object oriented design interview, because everyone is very familiar with music player, so it is easy to validate one’s OOD skills.

In this post, I’ll walk through the OOD (Object-Oriented Design) of a **Music Player**, a high-frequency topic often asked in system design interviews. I’ll go over the key aspects, from analyzing requirements to identifying core classes and methods, and suggest design patterns to enhance flexibility and scalability.

Object Oriented Design — Design Music Player— API and System Design Diagram

### Step 1: Understanding Requirements

To design a music player, it’s helpful to think from the perspective of an actual user. Reflect on your own experiences using music players, and list out the main features and actions involved. Here are some basic functionalities that almost any music player would need:

*   **Play, Pause, and Stop**: The ability to control playback is fundamental.
*   **Next and Previous Track**: Users often want to skip to the next song or go back to the previous one.
*   **Volume Control**: Adjusting volume up or down is essential for user experience.

Once these essential functions are clear, we can start thinking about additional features that might enrich the user experience, like playlists, song previews, and favorite tracks.

### Step 2: Identifying Core Classes

Based on these requirements, let’s identify the main classes that our music player system will need. Here are some candidates:

1.  **Song**: Represents an individual song, with properties like title, artist, duration, and potentially an album cover or file path.
2.  **Playlist**: Represents a collection of songs. It should allow adding, removing, and rearranging songs.
3.  **MusicPlayer**: The main class responsible for controlling playback. This class will handle play, pause, stop, skip to next or previous song, and volume control.
4.  **User**: This could represent the user interacting with the player and might store user preferences, favorite songs, and playback history.

### Example Attributes and Methods

Here’s a closer look at each class and its responsibilities.

#### 1\. Song

*   **Attributes**: `title`, `artist`, `duration`, `albumCover`, `filePath`
*   **Methods**:
*   `getDetails()`: Returns the song’s details (title, artist, duration).
*   `playPreview()`: Plays a short preview of the song.

#### 2\. Playlist

*   **Attributes**: `songs` (a list of `Song` objects), `name`
*   **Methods**:
*   `addSong(song)`: Adds a song to the playlist.
*   `removeSong(song)`: Removes a song from the playlist.
*   `shuffle()`: Shuffles the order of songs.
*   `getNextSong()`: Retrieves the next song in the playlist.

#### 3\. MusicPlayer

*   **Attributes**: `currentSong`, `currentPlaylist`, `volume`
*   **Methods**:
*   `play()`: Starts playing the current song.
*   `pause()`: Pauses the current song.
*   `stop()`: Stops playback.
*   `skipToNext()`: Advances to the next song in the playlist.
*   `skipToPrevious()`: Goes back to the previous song.
*   `adjustVolume(level)`: Changes the volume to the specified level.

#### 4\. User

*   **Attributes**: `favorites`, `playbackHistory`, `settings`
*   **Methods**:
*   `addFavorite(song)`: Adds a song to the user’s favorites.
*   `getPlaybackHistory()`: Returns a list of previously played songs.
*   `updateSettings(settings)`: Updates the user’s preferences.

### Step 3: Defining Relationships and Methods

Next, we need to consider how these classes will interact with each other.

*   **MusicPlayer** will manage playback for songs from the **Playlist**. It will retrieve the next or previous song from the playlist when the user skips tracks.
*   **User** can have multiple **Playlist** objects, enabling them to create and manage different collections of songs.
*   Each **Song** will belong to one or more **Playlist** objects, but it will be independent from the **MusicPlayer**.

For the interactions to work, each class must expose appropriate methods. For example, **MusicPlayer** will call methods from **Playlist** to get the next song, and it will use **Song**’s `getDetails()` or `playPreview()` methods as needed.

### Step 4: Applying Design Patterns

To make the system more robust and maintainable, we can use some design patterns commonly found in OOD.

### 1\. Singleton Pattern

Since we only need one instance of **MusicPlayer** at any time, the Singleton pattern ensures there is a single, globally accessible instance. This approach prevents multiple instances of the music player from playing simultaneously.

### 2\. Observer Pattern

An Observer pattern could be used to monitor changes in the player’s state, such as when a song starts or stops. This way, any UI elements (like a progress bar or notifications) can automatically update in response to playback changes.

### 3\. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern can help us support different playback modes, like shuffle, repeat one, and repeat all. By implementing different strategies for each mode, we can easily switch between them without modifying the core **MusicPlayer** class.

### Example of Strategy Pattern for Playback Modes

class PlaybackStrategy:  
    def getNextSong(self, playlist):  
        pass  
  
class ShuffleStrategy(PlaybackStrategy):  
    def getNextSong(self, playlist):  
        \# Return a random song from the playlist  
        return random.choice(playlist.songs)  
  
class RepeatAllStrategy(PlaybackStrategy):  
    def getNextSong(self, playlist):  
        \# Cycle through the playlist in order, looping back to the start  
        return playlist.getNextSong()  
py  
class MusicPlayer:  
    def \_\_init\_\_(self):  
        self.playbackStrategy = None  
    def setPlaybackStrategy(self, strategy):  
        self.playbackStrategy = strategy  
    def playNext(self):  
        next\_song = self.playbackStrategy.getNextSong(self.currentPlaylist)  
        self.play(next\_song)

This implementation allows **MusicPlayer** to dynamically change playback modes without altering its core logic.
