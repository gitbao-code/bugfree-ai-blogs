# System Design Interviews: Stop Making These 7 Costly Mistakes

System design interviews aren't a free-form improv session — they're structured conversations that reward candidates who think clearly, communicate crisply, and justify trade-offs. Below are seven common, high-cost mistakes candidates make, why they hurt your score, and exactly what to do instead.

---

## 1) Skipping Requirements
Why it’s bad: Jumping into architecture without clarifying requirements wastes time and leads to mismatched solutions.

Example: Designing a feature for "a large user base" without knowing whether "large" means 10k, 10M, or just a few hundred concurrent users.

What to do instead:
- Ask about user types, functional scope, expected traffic, latency targets, data retention.
- Confirm must-haves vs. nice-to-haves.

Quick checklist: Ask 3–5 clarifying questions, restate requirements back to the interviewer.

---

## 2) Ignoring Scalability Early
Why it’s bad: If you ignore load and growth, you’ll propose designs that break under real-world usage.

Example: Choosing a single-node database when the system must support millions of daily requests.

What to do instead:
- Estimate rough load (RPS, throughput, data size) and discuss potential bottlenecks.
- Design for scale from the start: caching, load balancing, sharding, and async processing where appropriate.

Quick checklist: Provide a ballpark traffic estimate, name potential hot spots, propose one scaling strategy.

---

## 3) Overengineering the Solution
Why it’s bad: Building an overly complex system wastes time in the interview and hides your reasoning.

Example: Proposing a multi-data-center, event-sourced solution for a simple CRUD app.

What to do instead:
- Start with the simplest working design that meets the requirements.
- Incrementally add features and complexity only when you justify them with requirements or scale.

Quick checklist: Present a minimal viable architecture, then explain how you’d evolve it.

---

## 4) Failing to Discuss Trade-offs
Why it’s bad: Every architectural decision has costs; interviewers want to see that you can weigh them.

Example: Recommending eventual consistency without acknowledging its impact on user experience.

What to do instead:
- For each major choice (sync vs async, SQL vs NoSQL, consistency vs availability), state benefits and downsides.
- Explain why you picked one option over others given the requirements.

Quick checklist: For 2–3 core decisions, list pros, cons, and your reasoning.

---

## 5) Missing Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Why it’s bad: Ignoring NFRs like security, reliability, and maintainability produces unsafe or unscalable systems.

Example: Designing a public API without rate limiting, authentication, or monitoring.

What to do instead:
- Ask about and address NFRs: SLAs, security needs, observability, and operational concerns.
- Sketch how you’d monitor, deploy, and recover (health checks, alerts, backups).

Quick checklist: Add at least two NFRs to your design and show how you’d satisfy them.

---

## 6) Weak Communication and Poor Visuals
Why it’s bad: Clear narration and diagrams turn your ideas into a convincing argument. Rambling or sketchy diagrams lose points.

Example: Talking through components without sketching data flow or interfaces.

What to do instead:
- Narrate your thought process: state scope, then walk through components and data flow.
- Draw a simple diagram early: clients, load balancers, services, data stores, caches, and async pipelines.

Quick checklist: Start with a one-line summary, then a diagram, then component-by-component explanation.

---

## 7) Not Practicing Enough
Why it’s bad: Without deliberate practice, you won't build the pattern recognition and pacing required for interviews.

Example: Practicing only whiteboard sketches without timing or mock feedback.

What to do instead:
- Practice mock interviews with peers or coaches, time yourself, and review recordings.
- Study common patterns (caching, sharding, queues, CQRS) and reproduce real-world systems from architecture blogs or talks.

Quick checklist: Do 1–2 mocks per week, review 1 real-system architecture weekly.

---

## Rapid-prep Checklist (Use this in the interview)
- Clarify requirements and constraints (3–5 questions).
- Estimate traffic and key metrics.
- Draw a simple diagram and walk through data flow.
- Call out 2–3 trade-offs and NFRs.
- Suggest incremental improvements and how you’d operate the system.

## Closing advice
Treat system design interviews as structured design sessions: clarify, design minimally, justify trade-offs, and communicate clearly. With a few targeted practice sessions and this checklist, you’ll avoid these costly mistakes and present stronger, more interview-ready architectures.
