**How would you design an experiment to test a price increase in a B2B SaaS product?**

This is a common and practical question in product analytics, growth, and data science interviews — and a real challenge many SaaS businesses face.

The decision to raise prices is high-stakes: done right, it boosts revenue and signals product value; done wrong, it leads to churn, dissatisfaction, and long-term brand damage.

### 1\. Define the Objective: What Are We Trying to Learn?

Before diving into experiment setup, we need to define the **business question** clearly:

> *Will increasing prices lead to higher overall revenue without significantly increasing churn or damaging customer relationships?*

In a subscription business, pricing impacts multiple dimensions:

*   **Revenue per user**
*   **Subscription cancellation rate (churn)**
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
*   **Brand perception and trust**

A successful price increase should ideally **raise revenue and CLV**, while keeping **churn low** and maintaining a healthy long-term relationship with customers.

### Why Not Just Focus on Revenue?

Revenue alone can be misleading. For example:

*   Revenue might increase in the short term, but if **churn spikes**, it could hurt retention and long-term growth.
*   If **high-value customers** leave, you might lose expansion revenue and upsell potential.
*   A price increase that causes **support volume or complaints to rise** can hurt the business in ways not immediately visible in revenue numbers.

That’s why your objective needs to balance **monetary upside with retention risk**.

### 2\. Experiment Design: How Do We Measure the Impact Safely?

### 2.1 Start With the Right Customer Segment

Pricing experiments are inherently risky — especially if different customers discover they’re being charged different amounts. To reduce risk:

*   Target customers who are **less price-sensitive**, such as:
*   Long-term users with high engagement
*   Businesses on higher-tier plans with proven value realization
*   Avoid brand-new users who haven’t yet experienced product value
*   Use customer segmentation (based on behavior, demographics, firmographics) to identify a “safe” group for initial testing

Starting small allows you to minimize backlash while collecting real-world data.

### 2.2 Avoid Traditional A/B Testing for Pricing

While A/B testing is a go-to method in product experimentation, it’s **not always appropriate for pricing**, especially in B2B contexts where:

*   Customers may communicate with each other and discover discrepancies
*   Seeing different prices for the same offering can damage trust
*   Legal or ethical issues may arise if pricing differences aren’t disclosed

Instead of A/B testing, consider a **pre-post experimental design**.

### 2.3 Use Pre/Post Analysis with a Synthetic Control Group

Here’s how it works:

*   **Pre-period**: Measure baseline behavior for the selected customer segment over two weeks
*   **Intervention**: Implement the price increase at a clearly defined point in time
*   **Post-period**: Measure the same KPIs over the next two weeks

To ensure the observed changes aren’t due to external factors (seasonality, macro trends), we build a **synthetic control group**:

*   Use **propensity score matching** to select a comparison group from users not exposed to the price change
*   Match based on features like company size, usage frequency, tenure, industry, etc.

This allows you to simulate a control group and isolate the impact of the price change more reliably.

### 3\. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): What Do We Measure?

To determine whether the price increase was successful, track the following metrics:

### 3.1 Subscription Revenue

The most direct impact of a price increase. Did the total revenue from the test group go up after the change?

Look at:

*   Total revenue
*   Average revenue per user (ARPU)
*   Net revenue change vs. control group

### 3.2 Cancellation or Churn Rate

Raising prices may drive users to cancel. You need to quantify this risk

> *Cancellation Rate = (Number of cancellations during post-period) / (Total active subscriptions before price change)*

Compare this to the control group and to historical churn benchmarks.

### 3.3 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Higher pricing may reduce the number of customers who stay, but the ones who remain may be more committed and more valuable.

CLV = ARPU \* Average Customer Lifespan

If CLV increases post-change, that’s a strong signal the new pricing is sustainable.

### 4\. Analyze the Results and Make a Business Decision

Once you’ve collected post-experiment data, compare the key metrics between:

*   The **test group (price increase)**
*   The **synthetic control group (no change)**

Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-test or Mann-Whitney U test) to assess significance:

*   Is the increase in revenue statistically significant?
*   Is the churn rate increase within acceptable limits?
*   Did CLV improve despite fewer users?

Then weigh the trade-offs:

*   If **net revenue increases**, churn is acceptable, and CLV improves, the price change can be considered a success.
*   If **churn spikes or CLV drops**, it may be a sign that the price increase is too aggressive or not aligned with perceived value.

### 5\. Plan for Iteration: Pricing Is Not One-and-Done

### 5.1 Continue Small-Scale Testing

*   Introduce price changes gradually across customer segments
*   Test messaging, packaging, or bundling along with pricing
*   Keep control groups to validate assumptions over time

### 5.2 Monitor Customer Sentiment

Even if metrics look good in the short term, monitor:

*   Support tickets or complaints mentioning pricing
*   NPS scores or survey feedback
*   Social media or community chatter (especially in B2B forums)

Long-term damage to customer trust can be costly and hard to reverse.

### 5.3 Align Pricing With Value

Ultimately, pricing should reflect the **value delivered to customers**. Use insights from customer interviews, usage analytics, and competitive benchmarks to fine-tune pricing over time.

### Final Thoughts

Designing pricing experiments in B2B SaaS is about **balancing data, empathy, and business sense**. It’s not just a question of “what makes more money,” but “what pricing structure aligns with the value our product delivers — and what do customers feel is fair?”
