When preparing for technical interviews, especially at top-tier tech companies, two of the most challenging formats you’ll face are the **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** interview and the **System Design** interview.

Despite the similar naming, these two formats assess entirely different skills. One is about modeling software through abstraction and responsibilities. The other is about architecting large-scale systems that can handle millions of users, data, and unpredictable failures.

If you’re unsure what the difference is or how to prepare effectively, this post is for you. I’ll break down what each interview type tests, how interviewers evaluate you, and how to prepare for each.

I’ve also built two dedicated courses — [one for System Design](https://bugfree.ai/course/system-design-basic/whats-system-design) and [one for Object-Oriented Design](https://bugfree.ai/course/object-oriented-design/ood-introduction) — to help you dive deep and build mastery, not just surface knowledge.

### What is Object-Oriented Design?

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) interviews evaluate your ability to design clean, extensible, and maintainable software using the principles of object-oriented programming.

You’ll be given a problem to model in code. These problems are typically inspired by real-world systems or domains. Some examples include:

*   Design a parking lot
*   Design a ride-sharing system
*   Design a library management system

**What you’re expected to demonstrate:**

*   Clear identification of entities, responsibilities, and interactions
*   Use of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism effectively
*   Proper application of design principles like SOLID
*   Use of design patterns where applicable (e.g., Strategy, Factory, Observer)
*   A strong sense of class relationships — composition vs. inheritance, interface segregation, etc.
*   Thoughtful trade-offs between extensibility, complexity, and clarity

**What the interviewer is looking for:**

*   Can you think in terms of responsibility delegation?
*   Do you avoid violating principles like tight coupling or leaky abstraction?
*   Do your objects represent real-world entities with clear behavior?
*   Do you separate concerns cleanly across layers?

**Underlying mechanisms that matter:**

At its core, OOD is about *type design and behavioral modeling*. A great candidate shows they can take an ambiguous domain and map it into a structure where each object:

*   Owns clearly defined data
*   Exposes well-bounded behavior
*   Interacts with others through defined contracts

For example, if designing a chess game, the interviewer is less concerned about whether the board is 2D or 1D — and more interested in *who knows what*. Does each `Piece` determine its legal moves? Or does the `Board`? Do you create a shared `MoveStrategy` interface, or hardcode logic into each subclass?

These choices reflect your thinking around abstraction, code maintainability, and flexibility — exactly what OOD interviews are designed to test.

### What is System Design?

System Design interviews ask you to architect large-scale, distributed systems. These are open-ended problems that require high-level thinking and deep technical understanding.

Common questions include:

*   Design a URL shortener like Bitly
*   Design a real-time chat system
*   Design a rate limiter for API requests

These questions aren’t about writing code. They’re about designing **systems that scale**, tolerate **failures**, and provide **consistent performance** under heavy load.

**What you’re expected to cover:**

*   Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
*   Estimate system scale (users, requests per second, storage requirements)
*   Define key components (load balancers, databases, cache layers, queues)
*   Make API-level decisions and sketch out internal flows
*   Consider replication, consistency models, partitioning, and fault tolerance
*   Think about edge cases, scaling strategies, and monitoring

**What the interviewer is looking for:**

*   Do you identify the core components early?
*   Can you estimate load and plan accordingly?
*   Are your components decoupled and resilient?
*   Do you understand trade-offs between latency, consistency, and scalability?
*   How do you reason through bottlenecks and single points of failure?

**Mechanism-level thinking that matters:**

System Design is not about naming the right cloud service — it’s about **transforming demand into throughput**, and organizing components in a way that the system stays reliable and scalable.

For example, if you’re building a chat system:

*   What’s your message delivery guarantee? (At-most-once, at-least-once, exactly-once?)
*   How do you store messages — in DB or message queue first?
*   How do you handle typing indicators or delivery receipts in real-time?

Each answer reflects how deeply you understand distributed system mechanics — things like backpressure, eventual consistency, sharding, rate limiting, and retry semantics.

### Key Differences Between OOD and System Design

Here’s a breakdown of how they differ fundamentally in scope and skills:

*   Object-Oriented Design is about **internal code structure** — designing class diagrams, responsibilities, and interaction patterns in a clean and extensible way.
*   System Design is about **external architecture** — designing scalable, distributed systems that meet strict performance and reliability criteria.
*   OOD problems assume a **single process** environment with a focus on maintainability and code structure.
*   System Design problems assume **multi-node, networked systems** with real-world failure scenarios.
*   In OOD, success depends on how well you apply **object modeling** and **design principles**.
*   In System Design, success depends on how well you handle **scale, complexity, and trade-offs**.

### How to Prepare Effectively

Both formats require practice, but more importantly, they require learning to **think like a designer** — of either software internals or distributed systems.

### Object-Oriented Design Interview

This covers:

*   Core OOD principles like encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and SOLID
*   Design pattern usage with explanation of where they apply and why
*   Detailed breakdowns of common OOD interview problems
*   How to identify classes, extract interfaces, and structure interactions
*   Emphasis on reasoning and trade-offs in class structure and responsibilities

### System Design Interview

This covers:

*   The system design interview process from start to finish
*   Core components like databases, caches, queues, load balancers, and CDNs
*   Estimating traffic, scaling requirements, and planning capacity
*   Step-by-step walkthroughs of real interview problems
*   Focused explanations on trade-offs between consistency, availability, and performance
*   Failure scenario modeling and how to design for resilience

Both courses go beyond surface-level summaries — they teach the **mechanism** behind each decision, which is exactly what top-tier interviewers want to see.

### Final Thoughts

Understanding the difference between Object-Oriented Design and System Design is crucial for interview success.

*   One tests how you write software in a clean, extensible, modular way.
*   The other tests how you build systems that work at scale, across machines and networks.

They require different mindsets, different preparation paths, and different mental models. If you want to succeed in both, you need to master both.
