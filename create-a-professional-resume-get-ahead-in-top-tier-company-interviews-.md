‚ú® Crafting a stellar resume is the inaugural step in your job hunt, and unquestionably one of the most crucial ones. Typically, the resume screening rate hovers around 10‚Äì20%.

Building a resume that aligns with professional standards becomes imperative. If your resume‚Äôs layout diverges from the standard templates most candidates use, HR personnel might struggle to pinpoint key details at first glance. Consequently, no matter how outstanding its content, your resume could be overlooked.

‚ö†Ô∏è It‚Äôs essential to be wary of some common resume formatting pitfalls:

1.  Keep It Concise: Even the resumes of seasoned developers and top executives are just one page. What makes you think yours should span two?
2.  Highlight Job/Internship Experiences: Prioritize work and internship details. Such experiences carry significant weight with HR, especially if they align closely with the job‚Äôs domain. This strategy is tried and tested.
3.  Be Genuine About Your Tech Skills: Avoid listing technologies you haven‚Äôt worked with or aren‚Äôt proficient in. Experienced interviewers can quickly discern any exaggerations.
4.  Extracurriculars and Hobbies Are Redundant: Not only do HR professionals typically skim past them, but they also consume valuable resume real estate.
