Some top common mistakes I have seen so far during resume screening, specifically about formatting, wanna spend sometime to point out several points.

#### 1\. Too much details with a long paragraph about your experience:

Make sure all your experience highlight the tech stacks, metrics, achievements you have, with bold font.

#### No highlighting your experience

If you have experience/internship in tech company, definitely put it ahead of technical skills and projects. The ordering of the sections usually can be like this:  
 **— For Junior**: Education -> Experience -> Project -> Technical Skills  
 **— For Senior**: Experience -> Technical Skills -> Education -> Project (Optional)  
Why ? because this is how we the hiring manager value the importance of each sections, you wanna catch their eyes at the very first galance.

#### Inconsistent format, wrong spelling or grammar:

big red flag, it shows whether you have done enough due diligence for your job applications.
