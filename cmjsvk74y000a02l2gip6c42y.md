Most engineers treat interview prep as a short-term hurdle to clear. That’s a missed opportunity. Reframe interviews as ongoing career development: each one reveals strengths, gaps, and the expectations of the field. Below is a practical framework to turn interview practice into durable growth.

## 1) Identify core competencies
Focus on the skills employers actually evaluate: problem-solving, technical depth, communication, and collaboration. Audit yourself:
- Rate each competency 1–5.
- Cite an example that proves your rating.
- Prioritize the weakest two for action.

## 2) Reflect on past projects
Use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to extract lessons:
- What was the challenge?
- What did you do and why?
- What measurable outcome followed?
- What would you change next time?
Document 5 project summaries you can adapt for behavioral interviews and your portfolio.

## 3) Set learning goals
Turn gaps into SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):
- Example: "Implement and deploy a production-ready microservice within 8 weeks."
Tools: online courses, focused books, and timed mock problems. Track progress weekly.

## 4) Network + seek feedback
Mentors, peers, and hiring managers reveal expectations and blind spots. Ask:
- "What would make me a stronger candidate here?"
- Request real feedback after interviews or mock sessions.
Use informational interviews to understand role-specific competencies.

## 5) Practice continuous learning
Keep up with tools, methods, and industry trends through:
- Small side projects that apply new tech
- Reading newsletters, RFCs, or recent papers
- Contributing to open source
Rotate learning topics monthly to avoid stagnation.

## 6) Keep a growth mindset
Treat every interview as data, not judgment. Log outcomes:
- What questions tripped you up?
- Which explanations landed well?
Use that data to iterate on answers, projects, and learning plans.

Practical next steps this week:
- Complete a 30-minute self-audit of competencies.
- Write STAR summaries for two projects.
- Schedule one mock interview and ask for targeted feedback.

When you stop prepping for single interviews and start developing your career, interview practice becomes a feedback loop that accelerates growth.
