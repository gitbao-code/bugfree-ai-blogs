# High-Scoring Meta MLE E6 Interview Experience — Key Takeaways

I recently completed a high-scoring onsite interview for Meta MLE (E6) after being laid off. Preparation was minimal, but the process was challenging and ultimately rewarding. Below I share the structure of the interview, the problems I encountered, and actionable advice to help you prepare.

## Interview overview

- Context: Onsite interview for Meta Machine Learning Engineer (E6)
- Preparation: Limited, but focused on core areas
- Outcome: Strong performance across rounds

## Rounds and sample problems

### 1) Coding rounds
The coding portion included algorithmic and application-oriented problems. Two notable problems:

- Logistics-style problem:
  - Typical constraints: scheduling, capacity, route planning, or resource allocation.
  - Focus on correctness, complexity analysis, and clear explanation of trade-offs.

- "Scattered bar" problem:
  - A unique, possibly combinatorics/greedy or dynamic programming challenge with a narrative twist.
  - Emphasize clarifying assumptions, writing clean pseudocode, and iterating toward an optimal approach.

Tips for coding rounds:
- Ask clarifying questions early (input sizes, edge cases, memory limits).
- Start with a brute-force solution, then optimize with clear reasoning.
- Talk through complexity (time and space) and potential pitfalls.

### 2) ML System & Model Design
Two concrete prompts I faced:

- Weapon ad detection:
  - Consider data labeling, class imbalance, false positive vs false negative costs, and moderation policies.
  - Discuss model choices (CNNs, vision transformers, transfer learning), pre-processing, and explainability.
  - Address deployment concerns: inference latency, content moderation flows, and safety monitoring.

- Reels recommendation system:
  - Focus on candidate ranking pipeline (candidate generation -> re-ranking -> personalization).
  - Cover features (user signals, content signals, contextual signals), cold start strategies, and feedback loops.
  - Bring up offline and online evaluation metrics (CTR, watch time, long-term engagement), A/B testing, and causal analysis.

ML design tips:
- Define the objective and success metrics upfront.
- Clarify data availability and labeling strategies.
- Discuss model lifecycle: training, validation, deployment, monitoring, and retraining.
- Talk trade-offs: accuracy vs latency, personalization vs privacy.

### 3) Behavioral / Leadership
Behavioral questions were intense with deep follow-ups on past experiences. Interviewers probed for ownership, impact, ambiguity resolution, and collaboration.

Behavioral tips:
- Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) but be ready to dive into any step.
- Quantify impact (metrics improved, time saved, users affected).
- Be honest about failures and emphasize lessons learned.
- Prepare stories around cross-functional partnerships, technical trade-offs, and situations where you influenced outcomes.

## General advice & preparation checklist

- Balance technical and soft-skill prep: both are critical for E6.
- Practice system/ML design regularly; sketch diagrams and end-to-end pipelines.
- Do mock interviews that include follow-up depth similar to onsite rounds.
- Study evaluation metrics and experiment design (A/B testing, causality).
- Work on communication: clearly explain assumptions, trade-offs, and next steps.
- Prepare for surprises: interviewers often introduce twists or probe edge cases.

## Final thoughts
Coming from a layoff, I found the interview experience energizing and validating. A strong showing requires both technical depth and the ability to tell compelling, impact-oriented stories. Expect the unexpected, practice iteratively, and sharpen both your algorithms and system design muscles.

Good luck — and remember: interviews test thoughtfulness and communication as much as raw knowledge.
