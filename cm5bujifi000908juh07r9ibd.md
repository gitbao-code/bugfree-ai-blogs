In system design interviews, the ability to draw clear and accurate diagrams is crucial. This not only demonstrates a candidate’s understanding of system architecture but also reflects their meticulous attitude in preparing for the interview. Let me share a story to illustrate this point.

Recently, I participated in a system design interview at a major tech company, competing against a candidate with 10 years of experience at a big tech firm, at the L6 level. The question was a classic system design problem of moderate difficulty. While the candidate’s answer was average — not outright failing — his diagramming skills were surprisingly off the mark. His drawing was comically incomprehensible, something even Van Gogh might not understand 😂. This made me wonder: was such a performance sufficient to pass the interview?

Regardless of the strength of a candidate’s answers, a lack of professionalism in interview preparation and attitude is a significant drawback. For those unsure about how to draw diagrams, I suggest looking at examples on [**bugfree.ai**](http://bugfree.ai) , and following a standard process.

Remember, a haphazard approach can make you appear foolish 🐯🤦‍♂️. In system design interviews, clear and standard diagramming not only helps in better articulating your ideas but also significantly enhances your professional image. Therefore, it’s essential to practice diagramming skills before the interview, ensuring you can express your system design solution clearly and accurately. Doing so will not only make you stand out in the interview but also demonstrate your professional competence and meticulous attitude. Good luck! 💪🌟
