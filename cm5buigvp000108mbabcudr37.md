Designing a Pastebin system is a classic system design problem that, while not as common in recent interviews, remains an excellent practice problem for beginners. Unlike more complex systems, a Pastebin-like design is relatively straightforward and follows some well-defined patterns, making it a great foundational exercise for learning system design principles.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key aspects of designing such a system. Feel free to think through your own solutions before reading on to see if your approach aligns with these suggestions.

System Design PastebinÂ Solution

### ðŸ’¡ Key Considerations

1.  **A Read-Heavy System**

Since Pastebin primarily involves users reading existing content rather than creating new content, itâ€™s classified as a read-heavy system. As such, the design should focus on **caching** and **database redundancy** to improve read performance and support scalability. Ensuring efficient read operations is critical to meet user demand and maintain high system responsiveness.

**2\. Classic Read-Write Separation**

In a Pastebin-like system, itâ€™s advisable to separate read and write operations. Estimating the expected read and write load independently allows for better resource allocation and scaling strategies. By implementing a **read-write separation architecture**, you can improve resource utilization and reduce response times for the high volume of read requests.

**3\. Handling Expired Pastes**

To manage storage and keep the system healthy, you need a mechanism to regularly delete expired pastes. This is typically handled by a **scheduled cron job** that checks for and removes pastes that have exceeded their expiration date. This strategy helps free up storage and ensures the system remains stable and performant over time.

**4\. Generating Unique URLs for Each Paste**

A core requirement is to generate a unique URL for each paste, similar to designing a URL shortener. The challenge is to create URLs that are both short and unique. Options include using **hashing algorithms**, **randomized character pools**, or database lookups to ensure uniqueness.

**5\. Extended Features and Design Considerations**

*   **Privacy Settings**: Allow users to set access permissions, ensuring only specific people can view a paste. This feature improves user control over content visibility.
*   **Deduplication**: Given the potential for duplicate content in a service like Pastebin, implementing deduplication can save significant storage and improve memory usage. This feature checks for existing copies of content and reduces redundant storage.
