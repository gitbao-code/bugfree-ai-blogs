System design interviews often feel open-ended — but they’re not random. Nearly all interview questions fall into one of a few **core system types**, each with its own set of design tensions, performance bottlenecks, and architectural strategies.

By identifying the **type of system** you’re designing early in the interview, you can structure your solution more clearly, anticipate trade-offs, and avoid wasting time.

Collections of System Design Questions by Types above: [https://bugfree.ai/collection/system-design-top](https://bugfree.ai/collection/system-design-top)

### 1\. Read-Heavy Systems

#### Definition

Systems where **read operations significantly outnumber writes**, often by orders of magnitude. These systems prioritize **fast, scalable data retrieval**, and are frequently accessed by a large user base.

#### Key Characteristics

*   High read-to-write ratio (e.g., 100:1 or more)
*   Read latency and availability are top concerns
*   Tolerant to some level of data staleness
*   Workloads often follow Zipf distribution (hot data gets hotter)

#### Design Priorities

*   Serve popular data with **low latency**
*   Prevent backend overload from high QPS
*   Prioritize **horizontal scaling** of read paths

#### Commonly Used Components

*   **Read-through or write-through caches** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** for static content
*   **Materialized views** or **precomputed data stores**
*   **Database read replicas**
*   **Bloom filters** or **count-min sketches** for fast filtering
*   **Sharded databases** for horizontal scaling

#### Common Pitfalls

*   Overloading the database by not caching
*   Missing handling of **hot key** items
*   Cache consistency bugs or cache stampede effects

### 2\. Write-Heavy Systems

#### Definition

Systems where **write throughput is the bottleneck**, often ingesting massive volumes of events, logs, or user interactions. These systems must maintain **durability, availability**, and tolerate **bursty traffic**.

#### Key Characteristics

*   Write rate often exceeds read rate
*   Backpressure, contention, and conflict resolution are major issues
*   Data is often appended, aggregated, or processed downstream

#### Design Priorities

*   **Ingest at scale** without dropping or delaying writes
*   Ensure **durability and eventual consistency**
*   Avoid synchronous processing where not needed

#### Commonly Used Components

*   **Message queues** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, in-memory queues)
*   **Write-ahead logs** for durable write capture
*   **Distributed log stores** or stream processing engines
*   **In-memory write buffers** and **batch processors**
*   **Write-optimized databases** (e.g., LSM-tree-based)
*   **Compaction/aggregation pipelines**
*   Writing directly to the database synchronously
*   Not planning for **retry logic** and **idempotency**
*   Failing to manage **storage growth** or **write amplification**

### 3\. Consistency-Heavy Systems

#### Definition

Systems where **correctness and data integrity** must be preserved at all costs, even under failure or concurrency. These often deal with **transactions**, **state transitions**, or **financial operations**.

#### Key Characteristics

*   Involves **shared state mutation**
*   High risk of race conditions, double processing, or stale reads
*   Trade-offs between availability and consistency (CAP theorem)

#### Design Priorities

*   Prevent conflicting updates
*   Guarantee atomicity and isolation
*   Ensure clear recovery paths on partial failures

#### Commonly Used Components

*   **Relational databases with ACID semantics**
*   **Row-level locks** or **advisory locks**
*   **Two-phase commit** or **distributed locking**
*   **Optimistic concurrency control** with version tokens
*   **Transactional outbox pattern**
*   **Compensating transactions** for rollback

#### Common Pitfalls

*   Skipping concurrency control (leads to overbooking, data races)
*   Misapplying eventual consistency in critical operations
*   Not designing for **fail-stop recovery** and retries

### 4\. Scheduler / Task Coordination Systems

#### Definition

These systems coordinate the **execution of distributed, background, or delayed tasks**. They focus on reliability, **idempotency**, and **state tracking** across async workflows.

#### Key Characteristics

*   Decoupled producer-consumer model
*   Tasks may fail or take time to complete
*   Results need to be tracked or retried

#### Design Priorities

*   Track task progress and retries robustly
*   Avoid task duplication or lost work
*   Manage worker health and scaling

#### Commonly Used Components

*   **Task queues** or priority queues (e.g., Celery, SQS)
*   **Worker pool frameworks**
*   **Job registries** or **task state machines**
*   **Distributed locks** or **leases** to coordinate work
*   **Retry queues**, **dead-letter queues**
*   **Cron schedulers** or timer wheels for recurring jobs

#### Common Pitfalls

*   Assuming tasks always succeed without retries
*   Not handling **worker crashes or duplicate execution**
*   No visibility into task progress/failures

### 5\. Trie / Proximity-Based Systems

#### Definition

Systems that serve **partial matches, prefix lookups, or spatial queries**. They rely on **specialized data structures** to answer queries efficiently based on user input or physical location.

#### Key Characteristics

*   Partial input must return useful suggestions
*   Must support fast lookups across large datasets
*   Spatial/semantic proximity often part of ranking logic

#### Design Priorities

*   Build memory-efficient indexes or precomputed maps
*   Handle fuzzy search and typo tolerance
*   Prioritize low-latency lookups over perfect accuracy

#### Commonly Used Components

*   **Tries / Radix Trees** for prefix matching
*   **Inverted indexes** for tokenized search
*   **GeoHash / QuadTrees** for spatial queries
*   **Autocomplete caches** and suggestion ranking layers
*   **Bloom filters** to narrow search space quickly
*   **Approximate nearest neighbor algorithms** (e.g., HNSW)

#### Common Pitfalls

*   Using naive linear search on large datasets
*   Forgetting memory limits of trie-based structures
*   Over-indexing without optimizing for update efficiency

System design interviews aren’t about memorizing patterns — they’re about recognizing **core system tensions** and designing around them.

If you open your interview by correctly **identifying the system category** and explaining its implications, you’re already halfway to a great performance.
