This time, the question is about desigining a food delivery system. The question is kind of hard in a way that:

1.  The scope is large, such as payment system, map routing system, order tracking system …
2.  It touches different parties: Rider, Customer …

Candidates will easily get lost when navigating these feature requirements. It is very important for the candidate to drive the conversation and lead the discussion to the domians where the candidate is most comfortable with.

Here are some of the key points.

System Design Diagram — Design Food Delivery Service

### 1\. Scalability & Performance

#### Scalability

Designing a system that can handle peak order volumes is critical. During peak times, such as lunch hours or special promotions, the system must efficiently manage increased traffic without degrading performance.

**Horizontal Scaling:**

*   Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to the system to distribute the load effectively.
*   Use containerized services managed by Kubernetes or Docker Swarm. These platforms allow automatic scaling based on CPU, memory usage, or custom metrics such as request rate.

**Load Balancing:** Use reverse proxies configured with algorithms such as round-robin or least-connections to allocate traffic intelligently.

**Partitioning:** Use sharding for databases where records are distributed based on a shard key, such as user ID or restaurant ID. Ensure consistent hashing to minimize data redistribution during scaling.

#### Storage

Handling the large and diverse datasets generated by a food delivery system requires robust storage solutions.

**Database Design:**

*   **Relational Database:** Use relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) for transactional operations like order processing and payment tracking.
*   **NoSQL Databases:** Employ NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for semi-structured or unstructured data, such as restaurant menus and user preferences.

**Partitioning:**

*   For scalability, partition databases by geographical regions to reduce latency and localize data access.
*   **Example:** A restaurant table could be partitioned by city, ensuring that each region’s data resides in its nearest data center.

**Caching:**

*   Reduce latency by caching frequently accessed data, such as restaurant menus and delivery partner locations.
*   **Mechanism:** Use in-memory key-value stores like Redis or Memcached. Implement cache eviction policies (e.g., Least Recently Used (LRU)) to manage memory efficiently.

**Data Replication:**

*   Ensure availability and fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes.
*   **Mechanism:** Use asynchronous replication for read-heavy operations, while synchronous replication may be preferred for critical transactional data.

#### Performance

**Database Optimization:**

*   Optimize database queries with proper indexing strategies (e.g., B-trees for range queries, hash indexes for exact matches).
*   Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently, reducing overhead during high traffic.

**Content Delivery Network (CDN):**

*   Serve static assets (e.g., images, restaurant logos) via a CDN to reduce server load and improve response time for users.

**Concurrency:**

*   Use asynchronous processing to handle concurrent requests effectively.
*   Implement message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka) for asynchronous job processing, ensuring that spikes in demand are buffered and processed sequentially.

### 2\. Real-time Tracking & Updates

#### Real-time Tracking

Providing real-time order tracking enhances user experience and builds trust.

**GPS Integration:**

*   Capture the live location of delivery partners using GPS-enabled devices.
*   Delivery personnel’s apps periodically send GPS coordinates to the server, which updates the user’s interface in real time.

**Communication Protocols:**

*   Use WebSockets for low-latency bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
*   Implement a WebSocket server that pushes updates to users whenever a delivery partner’s location changes.

#### Notifications

*   Notify users about order status updates, estimated delivery times, or delays.
*   Use a reliable notification service, with device tokens stored securely in the database. Use retry mechanisms for failed notifications.

#### Data Consistency

*   Maintain consistency in order states by recording all changes as a series of immutable events.
*   Use an event store (e.g., Kafka, EventStore) to log transitions such as “Order Placed,” “Order Confirmed,” and “Out for Delivery.” Event consumers can update the respective states in databases or cache layers.

**Eventual Consistency:**

*   Employ eventual consistency for non-critical updates (e.g., tracking data), ensuring availability and partition tolerance in distributed systems.

### 3\. Payment & Transaction

#### Payment Methods

Support a variety of payment methods, such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and COD (Cash on Delivery).

**Tokenization:**

*   Use tokenization to replace sensitive payment details with non-sensitive tokens, reducing the risk of data breaches.

**Fraud Prevention:**

*   Analyze user behavior patterns and transaction data to detect anomalies.
*   Employ machine learning models with features such as transaction velocity, geolocation mismatches, and device fingerprinting to identify fraudulent activities.

#### Consistency and Failure Handling

**Atomic Transactions:**

*   Ensure that payment and order updates are atomic to prevent inconsistencies.
*   Use distributed transactions with two-phase commit (2PC) or transaction managers to ensure all operations succeed or fail as a unit.

**Idempotency:**

*   Design payment APIs to be idempotent so that retrying a failed request does not result in duplicate charges.
*   Use unique transaction identifiers to track payment attempts and ensure retries update the same record instead of creating new entries.

**Retry Logic:**

*   Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures in communication with payment gateways.
*   Store the current state of the payment transaction and retry periodically until a success or a final failure state is reached.

**Payment Reconciliation:**

*   Periodically reconcile transactions with payment gateway reports to identify discrepancies.
*   Schedule reconciliation jobs that compare internal records with gateway logs to detect and resolve mismatched transactions.

### 4\. Order Matching

Order matching is a core function that ensures efficiency in connecting customers, restaurants, and delivery personnel.

#### Matching Algorithms

**Proximity-Based Matching:**

*   Match orders with delivery personnel based on their distance from the restaurant or the customer.
*   Use geospatial queries with databases like PostgreSQL (PostGIS) or MongoDB’s geospatial indexing.

**Capacity-Based Matching:**

*   Consider the current workload of delivery personnel to avoid assigning too many orders to a single person.
*   Maintain a stateful tracker for each delivery partner to monitor their active and queued orders.

**Hybrid Approach:**

*   Combine proximity and capacity-based criteria for optimal matching. Assign a weighted score to each potential match and select the highest score.

#### Dynamic Updates

**Reassignment Mechanism:**

*   If a delivery partner becomes unavailable, reassign the order dynamically.
*   Use priority queues to keep track of available delivery personnel, with priority based on proximity and capacity.
