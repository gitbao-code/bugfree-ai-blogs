This system design question is specifically tailored for new graduates and junior engineers. The reasoning behind this is that the requirements are simple, but they cover common and real-world system design challenges.

Here are the key points to consider (I encourage you to think through these before reading the explanations. These are questions youâ€™ll likely face in real-life work scenarios):

#### 1\. Real-time Consistency

*   How can we ensure that the data in the cache is consistent with the data in the database? This is often a question of **strong consistency** versus **eventual consistency**.
*   What kind of invalidation strategy should be implemented? Additionally, how should you configure the TTL (Time-to-Live) to strike the right balance between freshness and efficiency?

#### 2\. Cost-efficiency

*   How do we determine how much data should be stored in the cache? The goal is to maintain system stability while minimizing costs. Keep in mind, **in-memory caching** can be expensive.
*   The challenge here is to make the system efficient and cost-effective without sacrificing performance.

#### 3\. Fail-safe

*   What happens if a cache instance suddenly crashes? What if the backup cache also fails?
*   How can we handle cold starts for the cache, and what kind of issues are typically encountered during a cold start?

#### 4\. Multi-region Considerations

*   If this service operates in multiple regions or countries, do we need different caching strategies for each region?
*   How do we go about configuring region-specific cache policies to optimize for latency, availability, and local data laws?

While these questions seem straightforward, outstanding candidates are those who actively engage with interviewers by discussing different scenarios and requirements. Exploring the choices, pros, and cons of each design decision shows a deeper understanding of system design challenges.
