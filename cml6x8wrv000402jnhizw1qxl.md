## Stop Selling Numbers — Start Showing Impact

In interviews, it's tempting to drop big, impressive numbers: "We had 1M downloads," "the post got 100k likes." Those are vanity metrics — they look good on paper but convey almost nothing about your contribution or business impact. Interviewers want to know: what did you change, why did it matter, and how did it inform decisions?

Below is a short playbook to stop reporting vanity metrics and start demonstrating impact.

### Why vanity metrics hurt

- They lack context: 1M downloads over 5 years or 1M in one month are very different stories.
- They don't tie to outcomes: downloads, visits, and likes don't explain revenue, retention, or conversion.
- They raise credibility questions: if you can’t explain causality or business linkage, interviewers assume you don’t drive decisions.

### What interviewers actually want

They want metrics tied to decisions and business outcomes. Focus on things like DAU/MAU/WAU, retention, conversion rate, revenue, churn, customer lifetime value (LTV), and cost metrics (CAC). More importantly, explain why the metric matters to the business.

### A simple answer template (use this in interviews)

1. Metric & magnitude — state the metric clearly and over what period.
2. Context — baseline, cohort, and timeframe.
3. Business link — which KPI or business outcome did it affect and why that matters.
4. Evidence of causality — experiments, cohorts, A/B tests, or attribution approach.
5. Impact & next steps — numerical impact (%, $) and how it changed decisions.

Example — bad vs. good:

- Bad: “We had 1M downloads.”

- Good: “We grew downloads to 1M in Q1. More importantly, DAU increased from 40k to 70k (75% uplift) among the new cohort, 30-day retention improved from 12% to 18%, and conversion to paid increased by 1.2 percentage points — an estimated $120k monthly revenue uplift. We saw the effect only in the tested cohort and confirmed causality with an A/B test, so leadership prioritized the feature rollout.”

That answer ties numbers to a KPI (DAU/retention/conversion), explains timeframe and cohort, and shows decision flow.

### Quick interviewer-ready tips

- Always add a time window and the baseline.
- Tie the metric to a clear KPI (revenue, retention, conversion, churn).
- Mention how you measured causality (A/B test, difference-in-differences, instrumentation limits).
- If numbers are uncertain, give ranges and state assumptions.
- Normalize when necessary (per-MAU, per-user, per-session) so comparisons are fair.

### Metrics to prefer over vanity numbers

- Activation, conversion rate, retention (D1/D7/D30), DAU/MAU
- Churn, average revenue per user (ARPU), LTV, CAC
- Revenue growth, paid conversion, feature adoption by cohort

### Final note

Interviewers hire people who can turn data into decisions, not just report impressive counts. Use context, link metrics to business outcomes, and be ready to defend your methods. That’s how you build credibility.
