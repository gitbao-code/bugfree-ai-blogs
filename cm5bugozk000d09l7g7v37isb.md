Recently, I had the chance to conduct a mock interview with a peer who joined Meta just a year ago and had already reached the E4 level — a testament to the rapid growth opportunities at Meta. Despite having limited firsthand experience with system design interviews, this engineer clearly put in a lot of preparation, showcasing solid foundational skills.

The question we tackled revolved around designing a **Distributed Counter System**, and it covered some fundamental yet crucial aspects of system design.

Below are the key discussion points and takeaways:

#### 1\. Storage Design

The first challenge in designing a distributed counter system is determining the storage architecture. Some of the critical questions to address include:

*   **Redis Schema:** What should the schema of the Redis cache look like? For example, should counters be stored as simple key-value pairs, or would a more complex structure work better for scalability and performance?
*   **Additional Storage Layers:** Beyond Redis as an in-memory cache, do we need another persistent storage layer, such as a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a distributed file system, to ensure durability and fault tolerance?
*   **Distributed Storage for Redis:** Does Redis itself need to be distributed? If so, should we implement clustering to handle large-scale data or high throughput, and how would that impact consistency and partition tolerance?

#### 2\. Data Processing Architecture

When handling a distributed counter system, the data processing architecture plays a pivotal role, particularly in balancing performance, scalability, and data consistency.

Streaming vs. Batch Processing:

*   **Streaming Data Processing:** This approach is suitable for real-time updates, ensuring that the counter reflects the most current state. However, streaming can add complexity, especially in terms of ensuring exactly-once or at-least-once delivery guarantees.
*   **Batch Data Processing:** In contrast, batch processing can simplify implementation and is often more cost-effective, but it introduces delays, making it less ideal for real-time use cases.

**Frameworks:** Different frameworks support these processing paradigms. For example:

*   **Streaming:** Tools like Apache Kafka, Flink, or Spark Streaming could be utilized.
*   **Batch:** Frameworks like Apache Hadoop or standard ETL pipelines would suffice.

#### 3\. Read Flow Optimization

Supporting **high read traffic** while simultaneously handling **high write traffic** is another critical challenge. The following points were discussed:

*   **Real-Time Data Consistency in Redis:** If read operations rely on Redis, how can we ensure that the data remains up-to-date given the high frequency of writes? This is especially important in distributed systems where eventual consistency might introduce delays.
*   **Trade-Offs:** Achieving real-time consistency may require mechanisms like pub/sub updates, frequent cache invalidations, or syncing Redis with a durable storage layer. However, these come at the cost of increased complexity, latency, or resource utilization.

### Conclusion

This problem is considered an entry-level system design question, with relatively standard answers depending on the context and specific requirements. However, diving deeper into these discussions reveals the trade-offs engineers need to make in real-world scenarios.

For those interested in learning more, I’d recommend exploring open-source implementations of third-party counter APIs. There’s a lot to learn from how these APIs are architected to handle distributed counters effectively.
