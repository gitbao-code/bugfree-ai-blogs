### How to Stand Out in a System Design Interview

Our last chat revolved around the general frameworks and methodologies for system interviews.

Now, it’s time to explore how [bugfree.ai](http://bugfree.ai/) is revolutionizing the preparation game. Not only can you generate mind maps with this tool, but with a simple click, you can also produce comprehensive framework structures and flowcharts!

### 🔍 Detail is King

In system design interviews, while a broad plan is essential, the ability to detail out every component is non-negotiable. Interviewers are keenly focused on your grasp of detail and the clarity of your logic. If you can’t dive deep into each component, you’re opening yourself up to a world of challenges.

### 💡 Key Points to Consider

🏗️ High-Level Architecture:  
A recommended approach is to embrace the micro-service mindset. Depending on the specific functional requirements, break them into various requests, each handled by its dedicated service. Avoid the pitfall of merging all functionalities into one service; that’s a glaring red flag! A bonus? [bugfree.ai](http://bugfree.ai/) allows you to generate system architecture diagrams with ease.

🔗 API Design:  
Be clear on your API’s URL, inputs and outputs, and HTTP methods (Get/Post, etc.). Beyond the usual 200 responses, think about error messaging, such as 403 for user authorization failures and 500 for system errors. This reflects your grasp of frontend-backend interactions.

💾 Database Design:  
When designing a schema, you don’t need every single field/column. However, include vital ones that upstream and downstream operations would use, like userID or videoID. For expansive products or intricate entity relationships, contemplate crafting a relational table. For instance, beyond a User Table and Video Table, consider adding a User\_Video\_Relation Table for faster queries.

🔧 Other Essentials:  
Components like Cache design, handling Failure Scenarios, and evaluating Trade-offs are equally vital.
