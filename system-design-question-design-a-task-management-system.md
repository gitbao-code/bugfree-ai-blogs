This is a fairly common system design question, often used as an introduction to system design or object-oriented design (OOD). Before diving into the solution, it’s essential to confirm with the interviewer whether the focus is on system design or OOD, as the approaches for each can differ.

### Key points to consider for this question:

### 1\. How to Support Popular Tasks

*   The interviewer is likely asking how you would handle high-volume traffic for popular tasks. A common approach is to introduce a **Redis Cache** to offload frequent reads from the database.
*   **Follow-up**: How do you design the Key-Value pairs in the cache, and how do you ensure that the cache stays updated in real-time? Here, you could discuss strategies like cache invalidation, TTL (Time to Live), or a write-through cache strategy.

### 2\. Supporting Multi-user Collaboration

*   This is somewhat similar to the problem of Google Docs, where multiple users collaborate on a single document. In this case, simplify the problem by discussing with the interviewer the idea of limiting access such that only **one user can edit a particular line or task at a time**. This would avoid the need for complex conflict resolution algorithms.
*   Discuss locking mechanisms or optimistic concurrency control for ensuring smooth collaboration without data conflicts.

### 3\. Handling High Write Traffic

*   If many users are simultaneously editing tasks, performance issues might arise due to the heavy write load on the database. To mitigate this, you can introduce a **Message Queue** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to buffer the write requests.
*   Explain the advantages of message queues, such as **asynchronous processing** and the ability to **batch writes**, which can greatly improve the system’s performance under high load.

### 4\. Scalability and Feature Extensions

*   **Privacy**: How do you manage user access control, ensuring that only authorized users can view or edit tasks? This could be done through role-based access control (RBAC) or by designing an access control list (ACL) for each task.
*   **Nested Tasks**: How do you support the creation of subtasks within a task? Here, you can suggest a tree-like structure in the database, where each task can have parent and child relationships.
*   **Task Status**: How do you efficiently track and allow users to view task status? Consider creating an event-driven architecture, where each status change is logged and broadcast to relevant users in real-time.

### Conclusion

While the problem is not inherently difficult, the key lies in **communicating clearly with the interviewer** and understanding the requirements fully before diving into the solution. Avoid overcomplicating the problem by making unnecessary assumptions. Keep the design simple yet scalable, and address the interviewer’s concerns through active dialogue and clarification.
