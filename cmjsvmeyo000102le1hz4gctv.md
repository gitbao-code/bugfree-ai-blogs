## High Score Meta SDE Interview — Short Recap & Actionable Tips

A bugfree user shared a high-score interview experience for the Meta SDE New Grad role. The loop mixed challenging algorithm problems and behavioral conversations that tested technical depth, edge-case handling, and collaboration under ambiguity. Below is a concise breakdown and practical advice you can use while preparing.

### What the interview covered

- Multiple coding rounds focused on algorithmic thinking and robust edge-case handling.
- Behavioral rounds exploring problem-solving, difficult relationships, and navigating ambiguity.

### Coding rounds — problems and what they tested

- **Diameter of a Tree**: Tests tree traversal techniques (two BFS/DFS passes or dynamic programming) and handling of skewed or single-node trees. Tip: validate small and degenerate cases.

- **Ocean View (monotonic stack)**: Checks ability to use stacks or linear scans to maintain monotonic properties. Tip: visualize skyline scenarios and consider time/space trade-offs.

- **LRU Cache**: Classic design + implementation under constraints. Tests use of hash + doubly linked list (or ordered dict). Tip: practice clean, bug-free pointer manipulation and unit-test common sequences (get/put evictions).

- **Parsing English number phrases**: Parsing phrases like “one hundred twenty-three” checks string parsing, mapping words to values, and careful aggregation with multipliers (thousand, million). Tip: handle negatives, extra spaces, and zero explicitly.

Why these matter: interviewers are looking for correct algorithms, clear reasoning, and robust handling of edge cases — not just a working solution for the average case.

### Behavioral rounds — focus areas and how to answer

- Topics included overcoming tough challenges, resolving strained working relationships, and working with incomplete requirements.
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Emphasize measurable outcomes, what you learned, and how you adapted.
- When discussing ambiguity, highlight structured approaches: ask clarifying questions, propose hypotheses, iterate quickly, and validate with data.

### Prep checklist (practical & prioritized)

- Practice a wide variety of algorithm problems: trees, stacks/queues, hashing, parsing, and design problems.
- Drill edge cases and write quick tests for your solutions.
- Implement classic designs (LRU, LFU) from scratch until they’re second nature.
- Do mock behavioral interviews; prepare 6–8 stories with clear outcomes and learnings.
- Time-box problem solving and practice communicating your thought process aloud.

### Key takeaways

- Diversity matters: practice across topic areas, not just your favorites.
- Edge-case handling and clear explanations are as important as a correct approach.
- Reflect on experiences and be ready to explain trade-offs and lessons.

Stay prepared and confident — consistent, focused practice will pay off.
