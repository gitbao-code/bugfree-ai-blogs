🎉 Today we are excited to announce that our all-in-one System Design practice platform is officially live!

👉 [bugfree.ai](https://bugfree.ai/practice/system-design)

Some core features of this platform:

🌟 **Write**: In each section, users can write down their answers and thoughts.

🎙️ **Speak**: You can record your explanation for each section, and save it for future reference.

🎨 **Draw**: A sidebar provides a built-in whiteboard feature that you can resize or expand to full screen, allowing you to sketch your system designs while writing and explaining.

🤖 **AI Feedback**: The platform offers AI-generated feedback based on your answers, helping you refine your responses (AI functionality is still being improved).

🔍 **Hints**: You can view outlines, mind maps, flowcharts, framework diagrams, and other useful hints to guide your practice.

👉 **How to Start**: Simply log in to [bugfree.ai](https://bugfree.ai) on your computer, select a system design question, and start practicing right away!

Unlike other types of interviews, system design interviews demand more from candidates — we need to explain our design ideas clearly, write out design plans, and sketch system architecture diagrams all at once.

This process challenges your ability to speak, write, and draw simultaneously, along with your quick thinking skills under pressure.

This platform is specifically designed to simulate real interview scenarios, making it the perfect tool for anyone preparing for system design interviews. It features nearly 100 common system design questions, offering a comprehensive environment for practice and self-assessment.
