Continue guiding new joiners through system design practice questions, and today we’re focusing on the URL Shortening Service. This is a beginner-friendly topic, primarily aimed at familiarizing oneself with the foundational patterns of system design.

### Key Points to the Answer

#### **Requirement and Data Estimation**

First, by examining the requirements and estimating data, we can identify that this is a **read-heavy** service. Therefore, it’s crucial to consider how to handle high traffic efficiently while maintaining system availability. One common approach to address this challenge is to leverage **Redis cache** to handle frequent reads.

#### **Key Challenges**

The core functionality revolves around how to generate URLs that are:  
a) **High in volume** b) **Unique**, and c) **Sufficiently short**.  
To achieve this, it’s important to design a dedicated **URL generation service**.

However, this raises additional questions such as: What happens if this service goes down? How do we implement **fallback** and **backup** strategies to ensure continuous availability?

#### Exploring User Scenarios and Extended Requirements

It’s essential to dive deeper into user scenarios and discuss potential extended requirements. For example, should there be support for **expiration times** on URLs? What about **privacy controls**? Is there a need for **analytics** to track URL usage? Each of these additional features will require corresponding system components to be designed and integrated.
