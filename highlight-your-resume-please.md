We got hundreds of resumes to review everyday, so do other hiring managers and recruiters for the software engineer positions, so no more than 30s for screening each resume. And as you can see, we got no time to tell the candidates why their resume doesn’t pass.

Now here’re some hints on what we are looking when reviewing and what’re important:

\- Big Name Company: If you got a big name company (such as faang or hot startups) in your working experience or internship, you are killing it. It is very much the first thing we looked, and you are likely pass the resume screening.

\- Tech Company: If you don’t have big name company, at least it should be a tech company in a tech industry. As one of the top tier company hiring, we want to make sure candidate can adapt to the working environment quickly. (Fintech is OK, but banking company → hmm…)

\- Referral: nowadays, most of the candidate has referral, and weknow that many of the referer does not know candidate well, but just do it as a favor. What wewant to know is “Did the candidate actually works with the referer in our team or cross team’s manager?”, this plays a big factor because a) candidate’s skill is verified. b) we can build trust much faster.

\- Tile and year of experience: wesee someone apply for senior role without enough YOE. (For example, apply for senior engineer position with only 3YOE, apply for staff with only 5YOE), unless you have outstanding experience, we just reject it right away.

Below is how a standard resume should look like:
