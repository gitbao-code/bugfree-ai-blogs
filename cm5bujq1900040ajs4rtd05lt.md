How much time do we really spend on job hunting? Which step in the process is the most time-consuming?

In conversations with peers, a common theme emerges: the struggle to balance the extensive time spent searching for internships or full-time jobs while maintaining academic excellence. And amidst this, there’s a desire to enjoy the rare holidays, perhaps with a short trip with friends. Time, it seems, is always tight.

I’m curious to learn about the aspects of job hunting that you find most time-consuming. Is it tailoring your resume, submitting applications, coding interviews, system design interviews, behavioral questions, HR interviews, or perhaps the offer negotiation stage?

From what I’ve observed, a significant chunk of time goes into resume submission and interview preparation, especially in practicing coding problems.
