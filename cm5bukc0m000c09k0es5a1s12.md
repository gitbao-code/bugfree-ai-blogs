Having practiced on LeetCode for quite a while and experienced numerous interviews, I’ve come to realize one fundamental truth: the quality of code is paramount. This includes the ability to debug and articulate one’s thought processes. Sometimes, even if you solve a problem, a rough journey to the solution might not give a favorable impression in an interview setting.

I’ve made it a habit to document my debugging journey. Whenever I face a particularly challenging question or one I couldn’t solve, I turn to bugfree.ai for insights into the correct methodology and approach. These experiences, especially the mistakes and intricate issues, are cataloged for future review. It’s essential to thoroughly understand each category of problems before transitioning to the next. Later, when encountering similar problems, I revisit my notes to recall the solution and understand why I might have initially struggled.

When it comes to algorithmic problems, it’s not about the sheer number you’ve tackled but whether you truly understand and can apply the underlying principles.

Given the limited time at hand, focusing on efficiency and quality is the most scientifically sound approach to maximize the return on time invested.

The 2024 recruiting season is about to commence, and I wish everyone the best. May you all conquer LeetCode and secure your dream positions!
