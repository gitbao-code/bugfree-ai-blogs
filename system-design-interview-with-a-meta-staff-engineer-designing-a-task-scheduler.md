Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a mock system design interview with an E6 Staff Engineer from Meta. The topic was designing a **Task Scheduler** — a relatively simple problem meant to ease him back into the rhythm of technical interviews after years of not participating in the job-hopping scene.

Despite this, his strong fundamentals and sharp thought process were clearly evident, as he covered most of the key aspects of the problem.

#### Key Points as followings:

#### **1\. Requirements Discussion**

The first step in system design is to thoroughly understand the requirements. We started by discussing what types of tasks the scheduler needed to support. Key questions included:

*   **Task Type**: Will the system handle periodic tasks (e.g., recurring jobs) or ad-hoc tasks (e.g., one-off executions)?
*   **Resource Constraints**: What resources are required to execute a task? This includes runtime duration, network bandwidth, CPU consumption, etc.
*   **Optimization Targets**: Which part of the system needs optimization? Should we focus on minimizing latency, maximizing throughput, or ensuring resource fairness across tasks?

This discussion laid the foundation for designing a system that could adapt to both simple and complex task requirements.

#### 2\. Scalability

Scalability is a crucial aspect of any modern system design, especially for something like a task scheduler that must handle a potentially massive and unpredictable workload.

**Parallel Task Processing with Message Queues**:  
One of the first ideas we discussed was using a **message queue** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS) to decouple task production from task execution. By enqueueing tasks, the scheduler can distribute them across multiple worker nodes, enabling parallel processing and preventing bottlenecks.

**Handling Complex Tasks**:  
Another challenge arises when tasks vary in complexity. If a single task consumes disproportionate resources or takes too long to execute, it could block other tasks from running.

To address this, we explored solutions like:

*   Using **priority queues** to prioritize smaller, faster tasks.
*   **Sharding tasks by type** or resource requirements to ensure that complex tasks are isolated from simpler ones.
*   Implementing **dynamic worker scaling** so that more workers can be spun up when a burst of heavy tasks is detected.

#### 3\. Failure Tolerance

No system is perfect, so designing for failure tolerance is critical to ensure reliability. We discussed several strategies to handle task failures effectively:

**Failure Detection and User Notification**:  
When a task fails, the system should log the failure and notify the user promptly. This could be achieved through a combination of monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) and alerting systems (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack notifications).

**Task Retry Mechanism**:  
For transient failures (e.g., network issues or temporary resource unavailability), the scheduler should retry the task a configurable number of times. To avoid overloading the system, retries should follow an **exponential backoff** strategy.

**Handling Persistent Failures**:  
If a task continues to fail after multiple retries, the system needs a way to escalate or quarantine it. Potential solutions include:

*   Providing detailed failure logs to help users diagnose the issue.
*   Allowing users to reschedule or cancel failed tasks manually.
